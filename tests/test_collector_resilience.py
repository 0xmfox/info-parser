"""One flaky source must not cost the whole collection.

Both collectors used to let a single failure escape the loop: one X account that
timed out on `page.goto` discarded every tweet already scraped from the earlier
URLs, and one GitHub topic returning 403 discarded every repo from the other
topics. Nine X URLs and six GitHub topics per profile make that a coin flip on
every run. Now a failing source is skipped and REPORTED (never swallowed silently)
while the rest of the collection survives.

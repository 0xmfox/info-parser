"""Every label on screen must come from the catalogue, and must describe what the
code actually does.

Two classes of bug this file locks down:

* `unwatch` and `unban` were written into the markup as bare English words, so the
  Ukrainian build showed «Бан» and `unwatch` side by side in the same table row.
* `field.topics_help` told the user GitHub results are "sorted by recently updated".
  The collector sorts by STARS over repos created in the last 90 days, and the
  comment above it says the `updated` sort was dropped on purpose because it floods
  the feed. A help line that describes the opposite of the code is worse than none.
